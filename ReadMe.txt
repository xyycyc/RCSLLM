This section of the code handles data preprocessing, model invocation, training, and inference.

The dataset folder contains the original dataset files.

The result folder contains evaluation data from the experimental results.

The LLaMA-Factory folder stores the GitHub repository code for LLaMA-Factory, which is used for training and inference of the LLM. Additionally, it includes the yaml_example and pretrain_model folders for storing model invocation parameters and pre-trained model parameters, respectively.

Due to file size limitations, the dataset and GitHub repository have not been uploaded. Both can be accessed online. The data links are given in the paper Data Availability
